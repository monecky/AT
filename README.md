# Attack trees and bottom-up algorithm
This gitlab contains an object representing an attack tree. Additionally, there exist a read methode to 
transfer existing files about representing the attack tree to the object.

Additionally, the bottom-up algorithm is programmed for tree-shaped attack trees.
This structure is reused to program exact algorithms.
